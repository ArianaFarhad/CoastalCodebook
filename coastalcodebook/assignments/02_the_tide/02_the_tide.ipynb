In this notebook we will explore these concepts in a more interactive way, with some exercises, visualizations, and code. We will not repeat the whole theory, however, so make sure you have followed the lectures for this week and read the relevant pages in chapter 3 of the book."

    "The tidal signal can be broken down into multiple harmonic tidal constituents. These can either be diurnal, semi-diurnal, or longer-period constituents. Each constituent is characterized by an amplitude, frequency and phase, and individually looks like a sin/cosine curve. When we sum up the various components however, we get complex tidal signals, with spring-neap cycles, daily inequalities, and longer-term variations. Below we will compute the tidal signal at four different locations around the World: Scheveningen (Netherlands), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Galveston (Texas USA), and Jakarta (Indonesia). To do this, we will use six harmonic components: M2, S2, K1, O1, M4, and Mf. Section 3.7.6. in the book gives some more information on each constituents."

In the example above we included six tidal constituents. However, the most advanced tidal models currently predict tides using up to 34 different tidal constituents. The figure below shows an example of the total tidal signal in Galveston, from the FES2014 tidal model, using 34 constituents.
